# Othello
A recreation of the game Othello in python using pygame, with an option to play with various levels of AI or with a player sitting next to you, while choosing which color pieces to play with as well. The player will also have the option to view a basic guide and other tabs through a menu system, being able to exit the game at anytime.<br><br>

There are five choices or levels you can play the game with:<br><br>
**Human** - play against another human player on the same computer<br>
**Easy** - randomly generated moves<br>
**Medium** - greedy algorithm prioritizing most pieces taken<br>
**Hard** - minimax algorithm with move depth of two with alpha-beta pruning<br>
**Expert** - minimax algorithm with move depth of three earlier in the game, two in the middle of the game and five near the end of the game to minimize processing time while maximizing performance.<br>

Log files are generated to keep track of errors as well as prior games, for analyzing games (potentially in game in future updates) and debugging for any unexpected errors. <br>

To run the game, dowload the othello.zip file, unzip it, and run the othello.exe file.
